# SALT

This is a solver under development for the SALT equations (steady-state
ab-initio lasing theory), solving them directly as a sparse nonlinear
system of equations, as described in:

It was originally written as a standalone C program, but we are
currently in the process of connecting it to a scripting front end in
the [Julia language](http://julialang.org/).
